flavorTextMarketORADevaney,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_poincare score:1000
$id == ora_devaney","AddText"" Few ever fully adjust to and appreciate the stark contrast between the somewhat garish ornamentations of the ships of the Alliance outside the station and the slick, almost corporate, interior: For a moment one could think they stepped foot in a Tri-Tachyon stronghold. The reception is polite, the formalities expedited in just a few minutes and little stands in the way of profitable commerce. As both the primary secure bastion of the region, and a large market in and of itself due to the Alliance's reconstruction efforts, virtually all the local traders transit by this hub at regular intervals. These facts makes for an incredibly busy station, displaying a patchwork of ships models and flags rarely seen anywhere else in the Sector. Despite the clean and orderly outlook at first glance, a closer inspection reveals the underlying age of the station in the areas yet to be remodeled.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAPoincare,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_poincare score:1000
$id == ora_poincare","AddText"" As you step out of the confined atmosphere of your shuttle you suddenly realise how stale the air was. Despite standing on a busy spaceport the strong wind forces carry various scents from the nearby cultures. After going through customs and getting your 24 hours badge you are sent on your way towards the Interplanetary Market via Hyper-loop. The market is a pleasantly open space and is colorfully decorated and packed with people, but the smart architecture design limits the overall noise to a surprisingly comfortable level. Although you can not help but notice a strange feeling in your implants every time you connect to the info-sphere. Nothing bad in reality, just a fuzzy warmth in the back of your skull. That sensation gets stronger as you pass by an Alliance recruitment center.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORA3bodies,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_3bodies score:1000","AddText"" The icy plain your autopilot chose to land on shows no obvious sign of human presence, yet the landing gear finds some metal hidden beneath the carbon snow. Looking at the tiny sun in the distance and the frozen landscape battered by the winds, you ponder for a while if you really want leave the comfort of your shuttle. Suddenly a mound of snow collapses and two robots begin to spray your ship with antifreeze fluids. Through the comms a tired voice advises you to stay inside since any transaction can be done remotely and the drones can take care of the loading.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAJanus,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_janus score:1000","AddText"" Your warm clothing valiantly battled the freezing temperatures for a whole minute before icing, just enough to cover half the distance from the open air landing pad to the market entrance. It is with an audible sigh of relief that your away team penetrates the spartan but well-heated premises. Unlike other places in the Hegemony space, this concourse avoids the usual garish ornamentations and omnipresent propaganda, instead it opted for a properly paranoid amount of cameras to observe everyone's every moves.\n\n The only obvious sign of the Hegemonic allegiance of the planet is the unique phoenix projected onto the local Navy recruitment center."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAMarble,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_marble score:1000
$id == ora_marble","AddText"" Despite having been warned you are taken aback by the smell. Between the gagging stench of rotting moss and the bitter after taste of sulfur you instantly feel dizzy. A group of Port Authority agents wearing light breathers quickly escort you inside the administration building, where only a mild whiff remains. It is with an audible relief as you don one of the masks they give you. With the formalities expedited, you can finally access the main market. The reconstruction efforts require heavy hardware, which clearly skewed the planet's commerce balance toward imports, as the main export goods available are organic fertilizers extracted from their encroaching moss, and in smaller quantities some curiously blue alcohol extracted from it as well as some exotic game. You notice a stark difference between the Alliance's agents in slick uniforms and the locals in mundane attire.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAPendulum,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_pendulum score:1000","AddText"" While small compared to its counterpart around Poincaré, the station is just as busy. Inside the security feels somewhat tight, which is hardly a surprise considering this market exists solely to serve groups that could potentially be hostile to the main commerce partners of the Alliance, and to avoid needless friction between them. Despite the industrial nature of most of the complex, the concourse is vast and clean, a trader's last breath of fresh air before departing for the rest of the local cluster. In the center of the station you notice a large recruitment center for the Alliance, offering natural coffee for a few minutes of your time.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAShuffle,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_haunted score:1000","AddText"" The concourse is quite generic. Due to the high personnel turnover, the local personnel seems detached, and the decorations are jarringly soulless. Your small-talk attempts are met with monosyllabic replies, your allusions to the station's reputation with disdainful scoffs. \n\n Yet you can clearly tell who has been freshly assigned here and who has been here for a while. Those black marks under twitchy eyes do not lie.""textGrayColor",,,

FireAll PopulateOptions","Apparently the Alliance does not want any suspicious craft near their precious station: Your ship's hull is suddenly hit by hundreds of range-finding lasers and an entire tactical squadron of cruisers bring their broadside to bear. Through the comm channel you receive a stern order to keep away from the Spore ship, and to trade through the planet's starport until your standing improves.",,
flavorTextMarketORARefinery,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_refinery score:1000","AddText"" Since there is nobody in the immediate vicinity of the airlock, you deploy your security team ahead to find the locals. After a while they signal having found a few people several levels away from the docks. Once you get there they explain that the Alliance's patrols tends to randomly visit the station and round up anyone they find around, sending them to work on their reconstruction sites.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORASpore,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_marble score:1000
$id == ora_spore","AddText"" The concourse is properly massive, and while the station attracts large amounts of trade, the shops barely fill the space. Visible from anywhere in the plaza, the Alliance Logistic Center is the cornerstone of the system's economy, as most traders come here because of the insatiable needs of the reconstruction operation. Frequent security teams as well as automated drones patrol the station, although they attempt to avoid appearing threatening by concealing their weapons. You pass by one of the new temples of the Third Assembly, the recently resuscitated cult that involuntary planted the seeds of the Alliance before the Great Collapse. While newly emerging and independent from the administration, it is well respected within O.R.A.'s ranks. You inexplicably feel compelled to take a look inside and listen to their liturgy for a moment. One representative approaches you and asks if some of your crew would like to get interface implants, free of charge in exchange for them attending to a talk the day after. While tempting since some green horns don't have any and it would improve their performance, your schedule forces you to decline.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORACollector,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_collector score:1000","AddText"" The concourse has seen better days, and the station is obviously running at capacity to feed the Alliance's needs in Volatiles. Although not exactly overworked, the authorities expedite the arrival formalities and send you on your way as their attention already directed to the next incoming freighter. Despite the heavy automation you notice groups of exhausted laborers embarking maintenance ships under the supervision of Alliance Officials. Their attire appears to be awfully reminiscent of prison uniforms. As if on cue an alarm signals the rupture of a net's cable and the next team on the bench puts on their banged up armored suits.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAAst1,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == mlcht_ast1_market score:1000","AddText"" Your away teams boards the station without incident through the an airlock of the habitable modules. All systems are offline and there are signs of a fierce battle even inside. The entire facility's atmosphere was probably evacuated before hand to avoid explosive decompression as even the intact rooms are in a hard vacuum. There are many mummified corpses floating in the near micro-gravity, all pirates. Actually you can not seem to find any trace of the attackers, they must have repatriated their own fallen soldiers. The primary computer room had been destroyed and there is no way to know who attacked for sure, even if the Alliance's well known hatred for pirates leaves little doubt on their identity. In a mess, bodies are found with their hands tied and gunshot wounds in the back of their heads. The chief signals you that one of the docking clamps is engaged with a ship outside.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAAst2,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == mlcht_ast2_market score:1000","AddText"" The scanners reveal nothing and your team boards the station without incident. Without power repressurising the facility is an impossible task, additionally the artificial gravity is offline, greatly slowing down the search operation. They find a door leading to the server storage room but the entire module has been cut out of the station. Even more perplexing, the rooms seem to have barely been emptied before the station shut-down. The team gets blocked by several barred doors all leading to the main hall. Through the window they can see dozens of corpses floating inside. They do not appear to be wearing any common uniform except a few jumpsuits typical of independent traders... They only find a single corpse outside the hall, in front of the main door: hands tied behind behind her back, a large caliber gunshot wound to the back of the skull, a pirate gang tattoo visible on her neck. Pushing further through a depot your team finds booby-trapped crates of goods and supplies. If it was not for the obvious crater in the middle of the room they would never have seen this coming.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAAst3,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == mlcht_ast4_market score:1000","AddText"" The team penetrates the station through the docks, and the atmosphere is stale but breathable. They find a pair of old shuttles registered to pre-Alliance Malachite and a few supplies laying around, unspoiled. The crippled network informs them that the station has not been visited for quite a few cycles. Several rooms have been punctured by the explosion and the team has to install temporary portable bulkhead partitions to avoid depressurizing the intact ones. Despite the infinitesimally small chance of finding survivors, they run scans every few intersections. The team soon finds out that the two corridors leading to the habitation modules have been completely destroyed. After a short space walk and the installation of another set of bulkheads they finally find the station's occupants. The explosions isolated them from their ships and without an airlock they were unable to leave the section. The frozen corpses, all in civilian clothing, present extreme signs of anorexia. There are traces of fights near empty food distribution machines and one of the isolated room seems to have been used for mass suicide or executions. The images of mutilations, possibly self-inflicted, are particularly disturbing.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAChindi,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_chindi score:1000
$id == ora_chindi","AddText"" Exiting the airlock you are surprised by the brisk wind. While most of the planet is composed of deserts and savanna, the spaceport is located atop a mountain where the atmosphere is much colder. The location is so remote from the main population centers that you can barely see any locals among the people working on the various ships. The underground market district is comfortably warm and seems to attract many traders from the Core Systems, seeking those charming (and increasingly rare) hand-crafted goods that the planet was known for before joining the Alliance. In a cafe you overhear some Alliance representatives discussing the latest protest against the mandatory interface implants for all children older than sixteen. Come to think about it, you wonder why accessing the Alliance's networks always feels so smooth. Like a warm and comfortable scarf you put around your neck.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORASpin,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_chindi score:1000
$id == ora_spin","AddText"" The concourse is indistinguishable from one typically found in a space station, not surprising considering the amount of orbital dock parts used in its construction. Between the small population and the not quite luxurious but at least comfortable premises, it feels like a peaceful oasis far away from Chindi's troubles, or worse, Omale's ones. At the sight of the permanent smog of dust particles shrouding the city you cannot help but suffer a sudden mild sense of claustrophobia. For an instant you had the impression of being lost in nothingness. As you try to walk it off, you come across a wine bar. You might as well stop there for a minute, the excellent cellars of the Alliance always cheer you up.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAOmale,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_omale score:1000","AddText"" Before exiting the shuttle you have to put on a breathing mask. Short expositions to the unfiltered atmosphere should not be harmful but one can never be too cautious. The port authority agents seem to feel the same and they quickly escort you inside. The place is clearly on edge, with guards on duty next to every major airlock. Poincaré, Malachite, Chindi, Alatar, Camillia, Gneiss, Eros, Ararat, Vigie, Mathison, Janus, etc, every accent and every dialect of the region seems represented in the pandemonium of colors that is the market. You even caught a glimpse of Outer Terminus slang which is surprising considering their relations with the Alliance. The whole city feels as a transit hub: some people coming here with the hope of a better life, other having been condemned and on their way to Hell. In this case Hell being the name of an infamous nearby mine.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORATschai,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_tschai score:1000","AddText"" The settlement is clearly in its early development, with several of the official buildings still consisting of pre-fabricated mobile structures. As a frontier world, you can see that only the most devout Luddites have been sent. Many are praying near the temple before going back to work the fields. Despite using mostly manual labor to cultivate the ground, they welcome any technological help they can get to compensate for the somewhat difficult climate. Even in plain day you can still see the thin vapor trails of small meteorites entering the atmosphere. A brief flash indicates that a bigger one had to be destroyed by the primitive defense satellite network.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORARelay,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_relay_market score:1000","AddText"" No light, no heat, only a thin atmosphere left and no floor tiles, this station is clearly in the late stage of being scrapped and recycled for raw materials. There is nothing useful left to find here, the Alliance's recovery teams have the reputation of being thoroughly meticulous. Through your mag-boots you can ''hear'' the low hum of the superstructure twisting and shifting under the unbalanced load.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORALumen,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_lumenStation score:1000","AddText"" While the Alliance trusts you enough to let you disembark here, you still are not allowed further than the main loading area. And even then it was only after a thorough inspection of your ship's logs. The sheer paranoia transpiring from this place makes you regret coming here at all. Through a glass wall isolating a sanitized dock you can see an Alliance ship loading medical supplies and unknown electronic devices.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORACamillia,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_camillia score:1000","AddText"" With a cursory glance you can see the entire settlement on the surface, that is how little there is left to evacuate. Yet, between the infrequent shuttle trips and the increasing pirate activity it could take several cycles for the process to be completed, if ever. Given that all the industry has already been hauled away, there is not much to find here. Beggars and younglings plead you to give then a job, any job, on your ship so that they can finally get off this rock. They do not seem to hold any grudges against the Alliance officials working in the spaceport though, maybe because they are just as trapped as them until the very last transport picks them up.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORADock,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_dock score:1000","AddText"" Only a handful of modules remain but despite their decrepit exterior they are well maintained inside. This should not be a surprise come to think about it: The personnel seem bored to death since the only activity the station sees anymore is the more or less monthly shuttle taking a batch of Camillians to their new home in the Alliance. That and the occasional pirate raid a bit too close for comfort. As soon as you exit the docks to the market district you are solicited by people offering you and your crew drinks in exchange for some news from the rest of the Sector.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketORAAilment,TradePanelFlavorText,"$market.id == ora_ailment_market score:1000","AddText"" Your shuttle penetrates into what seems to be the underground spaceport of the only settlement of the abandoned planet. You notice a cargo ship landed there. At first you are surprised: the Alliance is not known for leaving anything behind when evacuating a colony, but circling it you discover that the ice roof partially collapsed on its side. Your away team rapidly finds a few corpses under the ice, then some more in the empty concrete building nearby. It seems that the entire crew was outside gathering any little scraps they could when the accident occurred, and they found themselves locked away from their comms by two hundreds tons of ice. They were somewhat fortunate in that the heaters of their suits failed long before they had to suffer the agony of starvation and dehydration. The freighter itself seems in relatively good shape, at least good enough to take-off, and is loaded with a not insignificant cargo of Volatiles.""textGrayColor",,,
