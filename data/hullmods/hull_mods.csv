Xeno-warfare Design,ora_design,,,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.ORA_design," The outer Rim Alliance uses ships that were originally created for the Third Assembly of Toban cult to defend themselves against a non-human menace. As such, their designs do not entirely respect the adages of more conventional navies.

 The ships put a strong emphasis on heavy broadsides using their long-range energy weaponry. However the centrally located engines cannot completely compensate for asymmetrical mass distribution. Thus, the ships get slower and less maneuverable for each slot left empty or under sized asymmetrically, up to a %s loss.

 The Third Assembly believed their enemy would be highly impervious to beam weaponry, as such their ships are optimized to install projectiles weaponry: Beam weapons cost an extra %s to install. However they also feared the massive use of missiles and torpedoes, thus Point Defense weaponry installation has been made easier giving them a %s cost reduction on ORA's hulls.
 
 Finally, to better protect their often elongated hulls shields emitters have been optimized to shape the protection field depending on its orientation.","Slightly raises the OP cost of installing beam weapons, reduce the speed of asymmetrically loaded ships.",graphics/ORA/hullmods/ora_design.png
